# sql-challenge

## Overview

For the Module 9 Challenge we were tasked with creating an employee database for a
fictional company. We were then to write sql queries to answer questions about the 
employees.

## Contents

Below I will outline the contents of this repository.

### EmployeeSQL

- analysis.sql - This file contains the sql queries to answer the questions 
posed by this challenge. I copied and pasted each question and then included 
the corresponding query.
- database_outline.txt - This is the outline I created to plan for the database.
- ERD.png - This is the ERD for the database. 
- schema.sql - This file contains the schema I used to create the tables in the 
database.

### Data

This directory contains the CSV files we were provided for this project

## Resources

I did not really stray from the examples that we were shown while working on
Module 9 to write the sql queries for this project.

QuickDBD was used to create the outline, ERD diagram and the schema for my 
database.

## Notes

- While the instructions mostly did not explicitly state for the output to be in 
any specific order, I did use *ORDER BY* on some responses to organize the output in a way 
that seemed more efficient. 

- In question 6 I used subqueries to generate the desired output. I could have 
employed the method I used in question 7 and used *JOIN* instead.
